Simplifications in v2:

- Redesigned the UI to be left-to-right, not right-to-left
- You can only see the entire alphabet; no subset of letters.
- The big letter isn't optional any more.
- Only the most positive encouragement phrases!
- Doesn't automatically go to the next letter if wrong 3+ times.
